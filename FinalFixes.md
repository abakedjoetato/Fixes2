# Tower of Temptation Bot - Final Fixes Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to achieve 100% flawless execution of the Tower of Temptation Discord bot. The plan is designed to be executed autonomously, with progress tracking built in.

## Current Status

- Command Audit Plan Completion: ~65%
- Bot Functionality Working Flawlessly: ~70%
- Core issues fixed (SlashCommand._parse_options, premium verification, database access)
- Files created/modified so far: utils/safe_database.py, utils/premium_verification.py, utils/command_parameter_builder.py, etc.

## Execution Instructions

This plan is designed to be self-contained and can be executed:
- Across multiple sessions
- In new conversations (without relying on previous context)
- With clear checkpoints for progress tracking

To start or resume execution at any point, simply refer to the latest "STATUS: Completed" checkpoint and proceed with the next one.

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. No monkey patches, hotfixes, or temporary workarounds
2. No changes to command output or behavior
3. Use only latest stable Python, Pycord, and dependencies
4. Clean, readable, documented code only
5. Logic must be scalable across multiple guilds and SFTP contexts
6. Premium checks must remain guild-scopedâ€”never user-based
7. All fixes must be atomic, readable, and complete
8. No web servers, SQL, or external layers
9. No piecemeal fixes - all changes must be system-wide and complete
